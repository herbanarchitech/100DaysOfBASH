#100DaysOfBASH 

I have been using Linux for almost half a decade now, and I am looking to transition into a full time poweruser , aka, sudo. So I have decided to take the liberty to invest time in learning BASH. 

In brief, according to Brian Fox and Chet Ramey , BASH is the shell and an interpreted language for the Linux/GNU-esque operating system. BASH is really cool as soon as one starts hacking together scripts to get rid of mundane everyday tasks. 

## Learning Objectives:

	+- Variables
	+- Logical Operators 
	+- Mathematical Operators
	+- Control Structures
		|_ conditionals

		+- Functions

		+- User Interface

			|_ Using Command Line Arguements

		+- Exception Handing (test cases for if scripts does not execute as expected)
